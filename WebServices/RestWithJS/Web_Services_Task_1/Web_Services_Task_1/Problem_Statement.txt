Problem:
	No dedicated avenue for students and employers to communicate with eachother on potential projects.
	
Consequences:
	Students are unable to find interships.
	Lack of networking with local employers lowers confidence in the institution.

Solution:
	Design an online portal allowing employers and students the ability to present projects and abilities to eachother.
	
Design:
	
	Employers:
		Employers will have the ability to store their company name and a contact person.
		Create and store projects that can be completed by students.
		Search for students that could potetially fill the requirements of selected project.

	Students:
		Students will be able to store personal contact information and field of study.
		Look up a list of projects that need someone with student's field of study.
		Select a potential project to bring up company contact info associated with selected project.

	Projects:
		Projects are created by employers. 
		Projects will store the number of students with a desired field of study needed to complete the project.
		
	Disciplines:
		Referenced as "field of study" above, disciplines will store generic field's of study, and specialties, or focuses. 
			Examples:
				A student's field of study is Computer Science with a focus in computer programming.
				A student's field of study is Computer Science with a focus in computer networking.
			Storing field of study alongside several focuses will allow for a robust pattern matching system.
